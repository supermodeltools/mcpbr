# This example uses the Anthropic filesystem MCP server.
# Replace with your own MCP server configuration.
#
# Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.

  name: "filesystem"
  
  # Command to start the MCP server
  command: "npx"
  
  # Arguments to pass to the command
  # Use {workdir} as a placeholder for the task working directory
  args:
    - "-y"
    - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
    - "{workdir}"
